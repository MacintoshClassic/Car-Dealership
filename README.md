  <h1>Car dealership project</h1>
  <p><b>Description:</b></p>
  <p>The web application for purchasing cars in the dealership.</p>
  <p>The web application was created for clients, where they can buy any available vehicle from the categories as cheap cars, sports cars, trucks, SUVs, military vehicles, and retro cars.</p>
  <p>First of all, we add some user information to the database as his email address, phone number, name, and surname. So we do with the car: brand, model, year, horsepower, price, color, and type. </p>
  <p>Once the database is created, the client can finally complete a purchase. Being on the home page user chooses the car type --> picks any available model --> clicks the “Buy” button -->  inputs his id --> receives the notification about the completed purchase. After the purchase has been completed the receipts data gets generated where we can see the order id, client id, and id of the bought vehicle. Clients also may check information about their orders by clicking on the "Check your info" button and inputting their id.</p>
  <b>Languages and technologies I used:</b>

    <li>HTML</li>
    <li>CSS</li>
    <li>Bootstrap</li>
    <li>Django</li>
    <li>Git</li>
   </ul>
  <p><b>P.S.</b> Code First Approach has been used in this project. I mostly worked on the backend, this is why the user’s interface looks pretty simple.</p>
